## Project Overview: Bike-Share Company Growth Strategy
Client: Cyclistic â€“ a Chicago-based bike-share program
Challenge: Convert casual riders into annual members to increase profitability.

Objective: Analyze how different types of customers use Cyclistic bikes and provide actionable insights to inform a marketing strategy focused on increasing annual memberships.

Tools Used:

Data Sources: Historical trip data from Divvy (Cyclisticâ€™s database)

Technologies:
- Excel - Cleaning Data [Download Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCTsHlZLm4L7-ueaSLwDg0ut3BP_V4mKDo2IMpaXrk4/template/preview?resourcekey=0-dQAUjAu2UUCsLEQQt20PDA#gid=1797029090)
- R - Data Cleaning , Manipulation , Analysis , Visualisations
- SQL - Data Analysis
- Tableau - Creating Visualisations and dashboards

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection.
- Standardizing Data
- Headers Naming Convention
- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved exploring the Cyclistic bike-share data to answer key questions, such as:

- What are the differences in riding patterns between casual riders and annual members?

- Which types of bikes are preferred by each group?

 - What times and days see the highest bike usage?

### Data Analysis using SQL
Including some code features I worked with.
```sql
-- Basic query to see all the data in a table
SELECT * FROM `divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Jan_Data` ;
SELECT * FROM `divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Feb_Data` ;
-- And so on
```
``` sql
-- Query to sort data by Ride_Id
select * from divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Mar_Data
order by Ride_Id;
```
``` sql
-- Query to check the total members using electric bikes
select Member_Casual,count(*) from divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Mar_Data 
where Rideable_Type = 'electric_bike'
group by Member_Casual;
```
``` sql
-- Query to see total user of electric and classic bike of people with membership
SELECT 
  Rideable_Type, 
  COUNT(*) AS ride_count
FROM divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Mar_Data
WHERE Member_Casual = 'member'
GROUP BY Rideable_Type
ORDER BY ride_count DESC;
```
``` sql
-- Query to see total user of electric and classic bike of people with casual membership
SELECT 
  Rideable_Type, 
  COUNT(*) AS ride_count
FROM divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Mar_Data
WHERE Member_Casual = 'casual'
GROUP BY Rideable_Type
ORDER BY ride_count DESC;
```
``` sql
-- Query to see total user of electric and classic bike of people with permanent membership in decreasing manner
SELECT 
  Rideable_Type, 
  COUNT(*) AS ride_count
FROM divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Mar_Data
WHERE Member_Casual = 'member'
GROUP BY Rideable_Type
ORDER BY ride_count DESC;
```
``` sql
-- Query to see total ride count according to the use of bike in a day also grouped by different membership 
SELECT
  Member_Casual,
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM Start_At_Time) AS ride_hour,
  COUNT(*) AS ride_count
FROM
  divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Mar_Data
GROUP BY
  Member_Casual, ride_hour
ORDER BY
  ride_hour
LIMIT 25 OFFSET 2;
```
``` sql
-- Qery to see most popular destination where the trip ended most of times
SELECT 
  End_Station_Name,
  COUNT(*) AS total_rides
FROM 
  divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Mar_Data
GROUP BY 
  End_Station_Name
ORDER BY 
  total_rides DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
``` sql
-- Query to see total ride count for casual members and listing out most popular destinations where the trip ended
SELECT 
  End_Station_Name,
  COUNT(*) AS ride_count
FROM 
  divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Mar_Data
WHERE 
  Member_Casual = 'casual'
GROUP BY 
  End_Station_Name
ORDER BY 
  ride_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
``` sql
-- Query to see average ride length for members
SELECT
  Member_Casual,
  AVG(CAST(Ride_Length AS FLOAT64)) AS avg_ride_length
FROM
  divvy-data-456911.Divvy_Data.Mar_Data
GROUP BY
 Â Member_Casual
;
```

## ðŸš² Casual User Bike Type Summary in R

- This R script filters the bike-share data to show how many casual users used each bike type:

### Key Questions Addressed:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

What trends can be identified in ride duration, time of use, and bike type?

What marketing strategies could effectively convert casual riders into members?

Findings Summary:

Casual riders mostly take longer rides, especially on weekends.

Members are more consistent, commuting during weekdays.

Docked bikes are used more by casual riders, while classic bikes are preferred by members.

Recommendations:

Target weekend casual riders with discounts or trials for memberships.

Promote benefits like cost savings, ease of commuting, and priority access.
Use data to launch personalized marketing campaigns (e.g., email, in-app notifications).
